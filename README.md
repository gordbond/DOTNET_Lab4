These projects were created for a school assignment, Lab 4. Lab4SeeSharp reads employee data from a text file 
and allows the user to sort the data using the command line. Whereas, Lab4B receives 
a list of HTMLTags and compares the number of opening and closing tags to determine if 
the file has balanced tags.
